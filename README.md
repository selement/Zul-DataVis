===========

A smashup of some stuff I'm working on for public testing.

If you want to use my code (I don't see why you would), just ask me. For the most part, though, none of the stuff I post
here is the complete picture. There is a lot of behind the scenes stuff that is proprietary to the system I work with.
All of these docs are just here for easy access for social debugging.

Finally and most importantly, thanks a ton to everyone who helps me out!
